# Dataset Information — Part 4  

This folder contains the **fourth part of the Bitcoin dataset**, used in this project for **testing and prediction**.  

---

## Dataset Details  

- **Part 4 (Folder: `data2/`)**  
  - Period: **Sat Dec 08 2018 17:57:00 – Wed Mar 31 2021 02:00:00**  
  - Purpose: **Used to test the Random Forest model trained on Part 3 of the dataset**  

---

## Usage in the Project  

1. **Training**  
   - The Random Forest model is trained on **Part 3** of the dataset.  

2. **Testing / Prediction**  
   - The **trained model** is then applied to **Part 4** (this folder).  
   - Predictions focus on identifying **buy/sell signals** in the unseen data.

## Summary  

- **Part 4 → Testing / Prediction phase**  
- Time period: Dec 2018 – Mar 2021  
- Ensures a realistic evaluation of the model’s ability to predict signals on **future, unseen data**
